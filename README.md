# MIPS-CPU

A basic implementation of a simplified MIPS CPU with pipelining. Built using verilog and python.

## Building and installing myhdl
myhdl is the python library we are using to connect the verilog code to the python code. Running ./buildmyhdl.sh will automatically download, build, and copy myhdl to the bin directory.
